Project structure
=================

Structure in flux currently, please see [#1195: Proposal to modularize the guardrail repo](https://github.com/guardrail-dev/guardrail/issues/1195)


- `root`: Contains tests and nothing else
  - `codegen`: Codegen core. Defines algebras and default interpreters.
  - `sample`: Contains integration tests for generated code. May be generated via `example` in the sbt console.

Coding guidelines
=================

- Readability
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Defer effects
- Typesafe accessors for Java function calls
  - [`Extractable`](../modules/codegen/src/main/scala/dev/guardrail/extract/Extractable.scala)
  - [`VendorExtensible`](../modules/codegen/src/main/scala/dev/guardrail/extract/VendorExtension.scala)
  - [`Tracker`](../modules/codegen/src/main/scala/dev/guardrail/core/Tracker.scala)

Writing integration Tests
=========================

It is difficult to tell if the code generated by the tool is functional and type
sound by structure alone. As unit tests are not enough, integration tests
actually run guardrail as a CLI tool to generate complete clients and servers,
ensuring everything works as expected.

The projects defined at `modules/sample-*` contain:
 - `target/generated`: Sources generated by `runScalaExample` or `runJavaExample`
 - `src/main`: Support definitions for generated code
 - `src/test`: Manually written integration tests against the generated code. These tests are run by the `runtimeScalaSuite`, `runtimeJavaSuite`, or the integration `testSuite` command.

By running guardrail, then attempting to compile the generated code, then
running integration tests against the generated code, we can ensure quality.

Adding a new swagger spec
-------------------------

Adding new specifications is accomplished by:

 - creating a file in `modules/sample/src/main/resources`
 - adding an entry in `exampleCases` defined in `build.sbt`. The available flags are largely undocumented, so [reading the parser](https://github.com/guardrail-dev/guardrail/blob/master/modules/codegen/src/main/scala/dev/guardrail/core/CoreTermInterp.scala#L67-L91) is necessary.

```scala
val exampleCases: List[ExampleCase] = List(
  ExampleCase(sampleResource("additional-properties.yaml"), "additionalProperties"),
  ExampleCase(sampleResource("petstore.json"), "examples").args("--import", "support.PositiveLong"),
  ExampleCase(sampleResource("polymorphism-nested.yaml"), "polymorphismNested").frameworks(Set("akka-http", "endpoints", "http4s"))
)
```

- First argument has to point to the newly added specification file. `sampleResource` looks up the specification in `modules/sample/src/main/resources`
- Second argument defines what package to put the specification into (For regression tests, `issues.issue1234`)
- `.args(...)` is variadic, and concatenates the specified args directly to the end of your command
- `.frameworks(...)` is the set of frameworks that this file should be run against

Adding tests
------------

Define your tests in `./modules/sample-*/src/test/scala` make sure to use
imports corresponding the previously defined `packageName`

Running the tests
-----------------

Use the `runtimeSuite` command inside of an SBT session to run code generation and execute the tests


Useful commands inside sbt console
==================================

- `testSuite`: Compile, test codegen, run sample codegen, compile sample, run tests inside sample
- `runtimeSuite`: Run guardrail, then run all tests against the generated code
- `cli`: Useful for scripting: `sbt 'cli --client ...'`
- `format`: Runs scalafmt against codebase
- `checkFormatting`: Verifies formatting, run as part of CI against PRs
- `mdoc`: Generate the doc microsite locally
