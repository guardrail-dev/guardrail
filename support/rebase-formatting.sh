# rebase-formatting.sh
#
# The whole point of this script is to distribute formatting changes evenly
# across your branch, without frivolous merge conflicts. It does this by
# carefully managing:
# - reverting formatting changes
# - applying your changes
# - reformatting your changes
# - folding the revert and reformat commits back into the original commit
#
# This script assumes a lot, but I've done effectively this same approach
# manually for years, so it seemed like a good idea to actually write it
# down.
#
# Assumptions:
# - You _must_ have a clean worktree, at least as far as modules are
#   concerned. This script does `git reset --hard` during its operation.
# - The two arguments passed in are _commit hashes_, not branch names.
#   This is to permit you to easily recover from any mistakes this script
#   makes.
# - You execute the script from a detached head state, again to permit easy
#   recovery from mistakes in the script.
# - You are running a reasonably recent version of BASH.
#   This was written against 4.4.23 on OSX.
# - If using sbt-client, the version of the scalafmt plugin loaded into your
#   sbt driver agrees with the version specified in `format_hash`
# - You _must_ have your branch up-to-date with the commit immediately before
#   `format_hash` for the greatest chance of success.
# - You _must not_ have upgraded to the latest scalafmt and reformatted the
#   codebase already. If you've done that, you can run this script from the
#   detached head immediately before doing the format, then likely simply
#   rebase the rest of your branch ontop of whatever this script leaves you
#   with at the end.
#
# Other oddities:
# - If you have a formatting-only commit, you may be dropped into a shell with
#   a recent message being effectively "Nothing to do!". Just type
#   `git rebase --continue` to proceed.


# Find a useful sbt runner. sbt-client makes this whole operation much faster,
# as running scalafmt in a warm sbt session only takes a few seconds, vs 20+
# seconds on my machine starting cold.
