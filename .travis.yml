# Currently skip building on non-PR and non-release builds (ie: Skip on master)
# PR validation and release attempts are the gatekeepers for test validation.
# This is only necessary currently as sbt-sonatype doesn't track which staging repo it uses,
# so sonatypeClose and sonatypeRelease get confused if multiple builds are going on at the same time.
# Currently, the maximum concurrent builds is set to "1" to avoid this race condition.
#
# This means that during releases, when the release notes are pushed to master, that triggers a build.
# Travis doesn't know it's safe to do a relase build (tag build) at the same time as the safety net master build,
# so the release build is always delayed by a full test run unnecessarily.
